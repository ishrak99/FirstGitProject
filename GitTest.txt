First login to git and Create new project name as "FirstGitProject"
Create a directory at you local machine and make a foder name FirstGitProject
Create a file name GitTest.txt
now copy all this content in there and run below commands

echo "# FirstGitProject" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ishrak99/FirstGitProject.git      >>>>> note this is add origin
git push -u origin master

As we have to add more files to existing project use below set of commands 

git init
git add GitTest.txt
git commit -m "adding GitTest.txt to FirstGitProject"
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ishrak99/FirstGitProject.git   >>>> note this is set-url origin
git push -u origin master

if you do not use set-url you will get below error:
    "fatal: remote origin already exists."
